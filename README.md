Taking the friction out of the real estate purchasing process. 

At first I wanted a site to fill out a purchase contract to buy a property.  Sending multiple offers can be time consuming.  I quickly realised this could be taken a step further to create a purchasing platform that could really simplify the process.

A platform for buyers and sellers to negotiate and keep track of residential real estate deals.  
Negotiating on the platform, instead of signing documents back and forth.
The platform will generate filled out documents based on user input.

One current need is to re-write the contract to avoid copywrite issues.

This will be a great tool for Agents, FSBO and unrepresented buyers
