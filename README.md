Taking the friction out of the real estate purchasing process. 

At first, I wanted to create a site that would fill out a purchase contract to buy a property.  Sending multiple offers can be time consuming.  I quickly realised this could be taken a step further to create a purchasing platform that could really simplify the process.

* A platform for buyers and sellers to negotiate and keep track of residential real estate deals.  
* Negotiating on the platform, instead of signing documents back and forth, including a BINSR.
* The platform will generate filled out documents based on user input, think of tax filing software.
* It should be able to fulfill the needs of most transactions, while more complex needs would still require real estate agents and attorneys 

One current need is to re-write the contract to avoid copyright issues.

This will be a great tool for Agents, FSBO and unrepresented buyers

Monetization is not a thought right now. I simply want to get this up and running, in order to help this complex process get simplified, with less risk and confusion
